  about:             |
    I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend systems, driven by a deep curiosity to explore and master new technologies. My journey in tech is fueled by a passion for continuous learning, whether it's diving into diverse programming languages like Java, Kotlin, and Python, architecting solutions with microservices, or leveraging cutting-edge AI models to significantly improve workflows. I thrive on understanding complex systems, from troubleshooting intricate framework bugs to analyzing application performance through techniques like heap dump analysis.

    With a strong bias for action, I believe in translating ideas into tangible results swiftly and effectively. Whether it's delivering my first code contribution within days of joining a new team, proactively resolving critical production issues, or leading initiatives to enhance system observability and reduce operational alerts, I focus on making things happen.

    My approach is centered on building with impact. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to optimize performance, streamline processes, and deliver measurable value. This is reflected in my work, such as drastically reducing integration times using AI, significantly cutting down job runtimes through multithreading, and developing tools that save valuable developer time. I am motivated by the challenge of creating robust, scalable, and efficient solutions that solve real-world problems.

    I am always eager to learn, grow, and collaborate on projects where I can contribute impactful backend solutions. Let's build something great together!
